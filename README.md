# Observability Examples

In this repository we will create some examples of observability infrastructure 
with example systems that provide data to it. **These examples are just to test and show how it works!** 
For production some changes must be made on the source code. These changes are related to
provided a more reliable infrastrutucture, like creating scalability to visualization and database endpoints
or securing how scrappers and system parts communicate each other.

The examples are inside the *"./examples"* folder and are divided by programming language. 
In the future, more examples will be added, even with pure infrastructure code will be provided.
All these examples are brought as is by **Venturus**.

# How to deploy the examples

The examples will generally be containerized, but some examples will use an IaC tool like Terraform or Cloudformation to be deployed
on public clouds.
The containerized projects will run on any machine that is running Docker(tested on v20.10) and Docker Compose(tested on v1.25).
The tutorial to run the examples are in their respective folder. In most cases, just following the README.md file is
enough to put them running.
